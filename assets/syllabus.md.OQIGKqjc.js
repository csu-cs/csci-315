Coding will be done in C++, but the concepts are not language-dependent.</p><p>This course is one of the most important in the major. Projects will require a level of design that is new to your programming career and will help to prepare you for real-world jobs. The ‘toolbox’ this class will provide you will be used throughout your programming future. The course serves as a gateway to many advanced courses. CSCI 315 is a <em>demanding</em> course, expect more work than previous courses. The projects in this class are more involved, requiring a deeper understanding of Computer Science.
