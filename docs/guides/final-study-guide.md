Final Exam Study Guide
======================

See [the syllabus](/syllabus#tentative-weekly-schedule) for the deadline.

> [!NOTE]
> In-person students must take the exam in
> class during the last class period and the official exam time.

This exam shall have 2 sections, each worth 50%:

1.  a GitHub/Auto-Grader with multiple problems and

2.  a Blackboard section.

Both sections will be timed and cannot be paused. Blackboard will allow you to
reconnect if you lose your connection. Each Auto-Graded problem will have a
separate time limit, as stated in its instructions.

The final will consist of programming problems and stepping through the
iterations of algorithms (showing the state at each step). Big O will also be a
significant topic during your final. Your Auto-Grader grade is based on the
percentage of passing test cases.

Included Topics
---------------

1.  **Data Structures**:

    -   Arrays

    -   Linked List (singly- and doubly-linked)

    -   Vectors, Stack, Queue, Circular Buffer

    -   Trees:
        +   Binary Search Tree (Ordered Sets, Ordered Maps)
        +   Heaps
        +   Priority Queues
        +   B-trees
        +   Quadtrees

    -   Hash Tables implemented via Chaining and Linear Probing: (a.k.a., 
        Unordered Set, Unordered Map,)

    -   Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)

        +   Types: Directed, Undirected, Simple (no loops or parallel edges),
            and Strongly-Connected (all vertices are connected)

2.  **Algorithms**:

    -   Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, Heap

    -   Searching: Linear, Binary, Depth-first search (DFS), Breadth-first
        search (BFS)

    -   Traversing: preorder, inorder, postorder

    -   Graphs: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

    -   Deleting and inserting into each data structure

    -   Copy constructor for each data structure

3.  **Other**:

    -   Compare/contrast, with *space complexity* and *runtime complexity* in Big-O
        notation.

    -   Know what each data structure does and how it does it.

    -   Recursive and iterative solutions to the above algorithms

    -   Function pointers and function objects

    -   Memory Allocation: Dynamic/Heap, Stack, and Static memory

    -   Templates

    -   Operator Overloading

Example Question
----------------

You may reference the [Midterm Study Guide](midterm-study-guide) for example
questions. The format will be very similar.

I have provided an example problem in the `exam2-0/` directory that you can try
before starting the real exam problems. Use it to understand the procedure
before you focus on problem-solving when timed.
